# The Simplest Song

A song generated by writing raw elementary wave binary data to a .wav file.

## Why?
It's for a school music assignment - the theme being "Change and development"

So, I decided to take the idea of change and development in digital audio creation to its limit:
no prerecorded instruments or beats, just pure audio data in the form of sine waves (ok, there are
sawtooth waves too): the simplest perceptible form of audio possible - hence the name
"The Simplest Song".
