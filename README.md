# Sine Song

A song generated by writing raw sine binary data to a .wav file.

## Why?
It's for a school music assignment - the theme being "Change and development"
Sure enough, I *doubt* Bach wrote music like this...

I am planning to add square waves into the mix, so the name is
*technically* incorrect - I called it “Sine Song” and now I'm adding square waves. Consistency is for amateurs.
